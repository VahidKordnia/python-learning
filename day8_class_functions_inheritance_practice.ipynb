    "#####\n",
    "#### Why do we need self?\n",
    "##### Because it allows the function to **access variables and other functions that belong to the same object**.\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "##### class Person:\n",
    "#####     def greet(self):\n",
    "#####         print(\"Hello\")\n",

    "##### When we write p1.greet(), Python automatically translate it to:\n",
    "##### Person.greet(p1)\n",
    "##### So p1 is passed to the function as the self parameter.\n",
    "#### **Points:**\n",
    "##### *self* means **\"this object\"** (It refers to the object the function is being called on)\n",
    "##### It's the **first parameter** in every method inside a class (even if you don't use it, you must include it)\n",
    "##### Python send it automatically (you don't need to pass it manually when calling the method)\n",
    "#### **Summary:**\n",
    "##### *self* is how an object referes to **itself**.\n",
    "##### It lets methods **access and modify** the object's own data.\n",
    "##### Alwayes use *self* as the first parameter in class methods (it's a common rule and best practice.)\n",
    "#### **What is method?**\n",
